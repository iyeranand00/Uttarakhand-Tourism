        Main article: History of Uttarakhand
        See also: Garhwal Kingdom, Kumaon Kingdom, and Uttarakhand movement
        Ancient rock paintings, rock shelters, paleolithic stone tools (hundreds of thousands of years old), and megaliths provide
        evidence that the mountains of the region have been inhabited since prehistoric times. There are also archaeological
        remains that show the existence of early Vedic (c. 1500 BCE) practices in the area.[32] The Pauravas, Khasas, Kiratas,
        Nandas, Mauryas, Kushanas, Kunindas, Guptas, Karkotas, Palas, Gurjara-Pratiharas, Katyuris, Raikas, Chands, Parmars or
        Panwars, Mallas, Shahs and the British have ruled Uttarakhand in turns.[28]

        It is believed that the sage Vyasa scripted the Hindu epic Mahabharata in the state.[33] Among the first major dynasties
        of Garhwal and Kumaon were the Kunindas in the 2nd century BCE who practised an early form of Shaivism and traded salt
        with Western Tibet. It is evident from the Ashokan edict at Kalsi in Western Garhwal that Buddhism made inroads in this
        region. Shamanic Hindu practices deviating from Hindu orthodoxy also persisted here. However, Garhwal and Kumaon were
        restored to nominal Vedic Hindu rule due to the travels of Shankaracharya and the arrival of migrants from the plains.

        Jageshwar Temples Complex are a group of over 100 Hindu temples dated between 7th and 12th century.
        Between the 4th and 14th centuries, the Katyuri dynasty dominated lands of varying extent from the Katyur valley
        (modern-day Baijnath) in Kumaon. The historically significant temples at Jageshwar are believed to have been built
        by the Katyuris and later remodelled by the Chands. Other peoples of the Tibeto-Burman group known as Kirata are
        thought to have settled in the northern highlands as well as in pockets throughout the region, and are believed to
        be ancestors of the modern day Bhotiya, Raji, Jad, and Banrawat people.[34]

        By the medieval period, the region was consolidated under the Garhwal Kingdom in the west and the Kumaon Kingdom
        in the east. During this period, learning and new forms of painting (the Pahari school of art) developed.[35]
        Modern-day Garhwal was likewise unified under the rule of Parmars who, along with many Brahmins and Rajputs,
        also arrived from the plains.[36] In 1791, the expanding Gorkha Empire of Nepal overran Almora, the seat of
        the Kumaon Kingdom. It was annexed to the Kingdom of Nepal by Amar Singh Thapa. In 1803, the Garhwal Kingdom
        also fell to the Gurkhas. After the Anglo-Nepalese War, this region was ceded to the British as part of the
        Treaty of Sugauli and the erstwhile Kumaon Kingdom along with the eastern region of Garhwal Kingdom was merged
        with the Ceded and Conquered Provinces. In 1816, the Garhwal Kingdom was re-established from a smaller region in
        Tehri as a princely state.

        After India attained independence from the British, the Garhwal Kingdom was merged into the state of Uttar Pradesh,
        where Uttarakhand composed the Garhwal and Kumaon Divisions.[37] Until 1998, Uttarakhand was the name most commonly
        used to refer to the region, as various political groups, including the Uttarakhand Kranti Dal
        (Uttarakhand Revolutionary Party), began agitating for separate statehood under its banner. Although the erstwhile
        hill kingdoms of Garhwal and Kumaon were traditional rivals the inseparable and complementary nature of their geography,
        economy, culture, language, and traditions created strong bonds between the two regions.[38] These bonds formed the basis
        of the new political identity of Uttarakhand, which gained significant momentum in 1994, when demand for separate statehood
        achieved almost unanimous acceptance among both the local populace and national political parties.[39]
